export const script = `{edit:id=intro}What's in store for the housing market in twenty-twenty-five? Lemme break it down for ya.{/edit}{image:id=602864342381;url=}{edit:id=YfcvHu4mdv}Mortgage rates are projected to come down, but don't expect to see the return of three-percent.{/edit}{edit:id=LhDl3r6ftf}Experts say they'll likely settle in the mid-to-low six-percent range by the end of the year. But that's all gonna depend on inflation, the economy, and a bunch of other economic factors.{/edit}{edit:id=vF8PtaYt7K}As for home prices, don't count on a drop. Experts say prices will rise by about three-percent in most places.{/edit}{edit:id=8S5MvK2O9z}That's because there still aren't enough homes for all the buyers out there - even though inventory is growing. Of course, this'll vary by area too.{/edit}{camera:id=mN5FA4XMuR}{edit:id=knu_BgTB5X}I know you were probably hoping for a steep drop in rates - but here's the thing. Rates coming down at all, helps your bottom line. Even if it's just a little bit.{/edit}{edit:id=outro}And slower price growth isn't bad either. It means any home you buy - or own - should go up in value in the year ahead.{/edit}`
